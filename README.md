Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the registration/absentee deadlines in 2020.
    - I can't find any information about early voting.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - Arguably the board members should be presented in lists or tables instead of generic divs.
    - Could use more structural tags like main, aside, section, etc. throughout.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - Text could use a bit more margin/padding in some places.
    - The header & buttons make sort of surprising color combinations, particularly on the Registration page.
